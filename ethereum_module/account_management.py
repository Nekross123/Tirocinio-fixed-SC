Ethereum Account Management Module

This module provides comprehensive functionality for managing Ethereum accounts including:
- Creating new Ethereum accounts with private/public key pairs
- Encrypting and saving accounts to JSON keystore files
- Loading and decrypting existing encrypted account files
- Managing wallet files in the ethereum_wallets directory

The implementation follows Prof. Andrea Pinna's approach from bcschool2023 for 
account management and encryption standards.
